This is a  basic recipe website created as part of The Odin Project.
It contains the recipes for three of my favorite foods: daal, haleem, and paratha, which all belong to Pakistani cuisine.

In making this website, I have applied some of the HTML skills I have picked up so far as part of the project including handling links and images, creating lists, and using elements and tags.
